<h2> Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression</h2>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of logistic regression for sentiment analysis. By analyzing text data, we develop a 
  model capable of classifying sentiments as either positive or negative. This notebook provides a step-by-step 
  guide through the process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
